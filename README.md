# Two-Centuries-of-Ultramarathon-Races-Data-Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on preprocessing and analyzing ultramarathon race data spanning nearly two centuries.
The notebook cleans, structures, and prepares historical race data to make it suitable for deeper analysis and visualization.

The primary objective is to transform raw race records into a reliable, analysis-ready dataset that can be used to study long-term trends in ultramarathon events, participant performance, and race characteristics.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python

- Jupyter Notebook

- Pandas

- NumPy

- Matplotlib / Seaborn (if used for basic visuals)

## 🔍 Detailed Analysis Description

This analysis explores nearly two centuries of ultramarathon race data to understand the long-term evolution of endurance racing. The study begins with a fully preprocessed dataset designed to eliminate historical inconsistencies and enable reliable trend analysis across time.

### Temporal Trend Analysis

Race data is analyzed across decades to identify:

- Growth patterns in ultramarathon events over time.

- Periods of acceleration or stagnation in event frequency.

- Long-term shifts influenced by changes in sports culture, logistics, and global participation.

This provides a historical lens into how ultramarathon racing transitioned from niche events to a globally recognized endurance sport.

### Distance & Event Structure Analysis

The analysis examines:

- Distribution of race distances and their evolution over time.

- Standardization of race formats across different eras.

-Emergence of popular distance categories and decline of obsolete formats.

This helps highlight how race structures adapted to athlete capability, safety standards, and international regulations.

### Participation & Event Density

The dataset enables evaluation of:

- Changes in participant counts across years.

- Expansion of race events across geographic regions.

- Growth in event density per year and per region.

These insights reveal how accessibility, popularity, and organizational maturity shaped participation trends.

### Data Quality & Historical Normalization

Special emphasis is placed on:

- Normalizing historical records with inconsistent formats.

- Handling missing or partially recorded data from early years.

- Ensuring comparability between early and modern race records.

This step is critical to avoid bias when comparing races across vastly different time periods.

### Analytical Readiness & Downstream Use

The final output is an analysis-ready dataset that supports:

- Time-series analysis

- Statistical trend evaluation.

- Visualization and dashboarding.

- Predictive or comparative modeling.

The structured dataset can be directly integrated with Power BI, Tableau, or Python-based ML workflows.

### Key Analytical Value

- Enables longitudinal analysis rarely possible in sports datasets.

- Demonstrates strong data preprocessing and analytical rigor.

- Provides a foundation for both descriptive and predictive analytics.

## ⭐ Notes

This notebook is designed as a data preparation foundation and can be reused for multiple analytical or visualization projects related to endurance sports data.
